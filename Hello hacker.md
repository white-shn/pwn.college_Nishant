# Intro to Commands
Invoke commands 

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cYopHUjQRwb_spnqhgt-iZEpwtA.QX3YjM1wSOzgjNzEzW}`

The first command to invoke was whoami , when i press enter it gives me my username , I just had to invoke the command simply .
Next to get the flag, I had to invoke the hello command and when I press enter it gave me the flag.

```bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ whoami
hacker
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{cYopHUjQRwb_spnqhgt-iZEpwtA.QX3YjM1wSOzgjNzEzW}
```

Then learned to invoke the hello command which gave the flag
