execute the whoami command and  invoke the hello command to get the flag

## My solve
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ whoami
hacker
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{cYopHUjQRwb_spnqhgt-iZEpwtA.QX3YjM1wSOzgjNzEzW}

**Flag:** `pwn.college{cYopHUjQRwb_spnqhgt-iZEpwtA.QX3YjM1wSOzgjNzEzW}`
