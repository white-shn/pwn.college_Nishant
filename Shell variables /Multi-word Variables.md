## Multi-word Variables

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0cxmMsrCx8zledTxz2jnuLc0YIA.QXwYTN0wSOzgjNzEzW}`

Assigned the variable PWN the value " COLLEGE YEAH" , we can't write it without doble quotes cuz if we write it like this PWN=COLLEGE YEAH.<br>
The shell will end the varibales assignment at the place the space comes and treat YEAH as a command. 

```bash
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{0cxmMsrCx8zledTxz2jnuLc0YIA.QXwYTN0wSOzgjNzEzW}
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ 
```
