## Tab completion on commands 
Type pwncollege and hit the tab key to auto complete the command which has the flag

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QNEgO_IXPuNu6PSZ_ZNKlVs26zq.0VN0EzNxwSOzgjNzEzW}`

I typed the start of the name of the command 'pwncollege' and then pressed tab which gave me the correct name of the command 

```bash
hacker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$ pwncollege-20764 
Correct! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{QNEgO_IXPuNu6PSZ_ZNKlVs26zq.0VN0EzNxwSOzgjNzEzW}
```
