## Zahard's Welcome
The base of Citadel rises before you, its great doors sealed with fractured steel and dead circuitry. Faded corporate protocols still hum in the lock, relics of the world that fell.

Those who came before tried to climb but all failed. Their echoes linger as fragments of voices, reminders of broken attempts to free humanity. Now you have chosen to take their place. You will be the one to scale the Citadel and finish what they could not.

The voices of the fallen whisper through the static: “The path begins in the gathering place. There, candidates are chosen.”

Here is your invitation - https://discord.gg/FfBw8VzfRR. Step into the gathering place where all climbers are briefed before the ascent
